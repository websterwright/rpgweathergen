# rpgweathergen
Weather generator for old-school RPG wilderness adventures.

I'm using this for my own campaign which is why I have the weird month names on the landing page (they correspond to the normal months, 1.January 2.February 3.March etc.) and I needed somewhere to host the files. Since they have to be public you can use the generator if you'd like, but I don't have any intention of updating the generator very much myself beyond my own personal use.
